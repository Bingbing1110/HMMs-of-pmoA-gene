# HMMs-of-pmoA-gene
This repository was created to share the HMMs of three clusters of particulate methane monooxygenase (pmoA) gene.
Three HMMs of cluster I, II, III of pmoA gene were constructed using HMMER software (Version 3.0). 
The seed sequences of the three clusters were also supplemented in directory "pmoA seed sequences".
The HMMs of pmoA gene can be used to annotate pmoA gene from metagenomic sequencing data by Xander software or other tools.
